Problem Statement: The need for effective and efficient predictive tools to identify the risk of diabetes onset in the early stages among female patients. 

Research Goals:  We intend on creating a predictive model to determine the onset of diabetes in female patients based on health-related attributes such as glucose levels, BMI, age, and family diabetes history. Furthermore, the research seeks to evaluate the performance and practical applicability of different classification algorithms in predicting diabetes, thereby contributing to improved health outcomes through targeted interventions and personalized patient care. 

Data Sources:  

Diabetes Dataset 
Columns: 

Pregnancies (Integer): Number of times the patient has been pregnant. 

Glucose (Integer): Plasma glucose concentration (mg/dL) after a 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test. 

BloodPressure (Integer): Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg). 

SkinThickness (Integer): Triceps skinfold thickness (mm). 

Insulin (Integer): 2-hour serum insulin (mu U/ml). 

BMI (Float): Body mass index, defined as weight in kg/(height in m)^2. 

DiabetesPedigreeFunction (Float): A score indicating genetic predisposition to diabetes based on family history. 

Age (Integer): Age of the patient (in years). 

Outcome (Binary): Target variable where 1 indicates diabetes, and 0 indicates no diabetes.
